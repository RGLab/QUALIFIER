\usage{
\S4method{plot}{qaTask,ANY}(x, y, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{qaTask} object}

\item{y}{a \code{formula} describing the variables to be used for plotting.
see \code{\link{qaCheck}} for more details.}

\item{...}{arguments to control the output.

pop:a character scalar indicating the population name.If provided,it
overwrites the pop slot in qaTask object.


subset:a logical expression as a filter. see \code{\link{qaCheck}} for more
details.

width,height:size specification for the svg output.

dest: a character specifying the output path. It is NULL by default, which
indicates using the regular R device as the output.  Otherwise it outputs to
a svg file.

plotAll: a logical/character scalar indicating whether to plot the 1D/2D
density plot for all the individual FCS files together with the summary
plot(either xyplot or bwplot).  It is only valid when \code{dest} is
specified as non-null path.  It is FALSE by default,indicating that only the
FCS files that are marked as outliers by \code{qaCheck} are plotted.  If
TRUE, all FCS files are plotted ,which should be used cautously since it
could be time consuming for a large dataset.  When it is "none",no scatter
plot will be generated.

scatterPlot: a logical scalar. When TRUE, the density(scatter) plot is
plotted instead of the summary plot(xyplot/bwplot)

scatterPar: A list storing all the fliwViz arguments. see \link[flowViz:xyplot]{xyplot}

par:A list storing all the lattice arguments.If provided,it overwrites the
par slot of qaTask object.

outerStrip: a \code{logical} indicating whether to enable \link[latticeExtra:useOuterStrips]{useOuterStrips}

strip.lines,strip.left.lines: arguments passed to \link[latticeExtra:useOuterStrips]{useOuterStrips}}

\description{
plot the statistics for a particular cell population of a group of
samples,this method is usually called after \code{qaCheck} to visualize the
QA results.
}
\details{
The method does the same thing as \code{qaCheck} in terms of parsing the
formula and selecting the gated population,statistics and subsetting the
samples. The difference is that it reads the outliers detection results saved
in database and hightlight them in the summary plots. Two kinds of lattice
plots are currently supported:xyplot and bwplot(boxplot),depends on the
\code{plotType} in \code{qaTask} object. When the output path is provided by
\code{dest}, the svg plot is generated.  In svg plot, each dot or box (or
only the one marked as outliers) is annotated by the tooltip or
hyperlink.which further points to the individual density plot of the gated
population.

with \code{scatterPlot} and \code{subset} arguments, scatter plots can be
generated for the selected FCS files or sample groups,which allows users to
investigate the individual outlier groups or files.
